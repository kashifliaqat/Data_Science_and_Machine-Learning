# Reinforcement Learning

**Task:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the CartPole problem using environment from OpenAI Gym.

## The Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn to take actions that maximize its cumulative reward over time.

### Basic structure
The basic structure of reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment in a series of discrete time steps. At each time step, the agent observes the current state of the environment and selects an action to take. The environment then transitions to a new state, and the agent receives a reward based on the new state and the action taken.

The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maps states to actions in a way that maximizes its cumulative reward over time. This is typically done using a value function or a Q-function, which estimates the expected cumulative reward from each state or state-action pair.

### Types of reinforcement learning

1. **Model-based Reinforcement Learning:** In this type, the agent learns a model of the environment and uses it to make decisions.

2. **Model-free Reinforcement Learning:** In this type, the agent learns directly from experience without building a model of the environment.

3. **Value-based Reinforcement Learning:** In this type, the agent learns the value of different actions in different states of the environment.

### Mathematical Formulation

In reinforcement learning, the agent tries to maximize its cumulative reward over time. This can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), which consists of:

- A set of states `S`
- A set of actions `A`
- A set of rewards `R`
- A transition function `P(s,a,s')` that defines the probability of moving from state `s` to state `s'` when taking action `a`
- A discount factor `gamma` that determines the importance of future rewards.

The goal is to find a policy `pi` that maps each state `s` to an action `a` that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. This can be done using various algorithms, such as Q-learning or policy gradient methods.
