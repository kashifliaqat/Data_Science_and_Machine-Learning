# Perceptron

## Task
Perform binary classification on cancer dataset from Scikit-learn by building a perceptron model from scratch. 

## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset is part of the datasets provided by Scikit-learn. The dataset reports weather a given tumor is benign or malignant based on its characteristics (represented by the various features in the dataset). 

A detailed description and visualization of the cancer dataset is provided in the [Perceptron Notebook](https://github.com/kashifliaqat/Data_Science_and_Machine-Learning/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/1_Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb). 

## The Perceptron
The perceptron is a single-layer neural network that can be used for binary classification tasks, meaning it can classify inputs into one of two categories.

The perceptron is inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the human brain. Like biological neurons, artificial neurons in a perceptron receive input signals from other neurons, process these signals, and produce output signals.
